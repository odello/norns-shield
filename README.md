# norns-shield

![](images/norns-shield-black.jpg)

minimal/tiny open-source/DIY shield for Raspberry Pi boards, providing hardware compatibility with the [norns](https://monome.org) ecosystem.

- audio codec: CS4270
- audio jacks: 3.5mm stereo in/out, line level
- OLED: NHD-2.7-12864WDW3
- 3x pushbuttons, 3x rotary encoders

## assembly

for SMD-populated circuit.

parts shown (header already soldered to OLED)

![](images/assembly/ns-0.jpg)

first solder the OLED header (make sure the orientation looks like the photo below, as we've had a few reports of folks placing their headers on the wrong side). then the encoders, and keys.

then attach the pi header to the other side and solder as shown.

attach the screen to the top. note that you may have to apply substantial pressure for it to connect: put something hard on top of the header while applying pressure so you don't wreck your thumbs.

likewise, attaching the keycaps requires substantial pressure. be sure they are aligned well then press hard.

the knobs should go on easily in comparison.

attach the shortest spacers with short screws, which props up the screen.

four spacers with the male thread insert from the top. for the bottom, the long remaining spacers go in front, shorter in back as shown.

align the plate and attach with short screws. don't tighten the screws until you've aligned the keys and knobs, as there's a little wiggle room for fine tuning.

attach the pi and add two plastic spacers, then balance the plate on top. the holes with spacers need the two long screws, the front use short screws.

## setting up

get [the latest shield image from github](https://github.com/monome/norns-image/releases).

use [etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to make your SD card. it's by far the most reliable method.


## troubleshooting

- most soldering problems can be solved simply by reheating solder joints. bad solders can result in various problems: screen doesn't turn on, knobs/keys don't work.
- use a good SD card, not a cheap one. if you're having trouble, try using a different card.
- be sure to use the correct power supply. the pi will not power well from a laptop and you'll get confusing errors. get a dedicated 2A USB supply, or very high output USB battery.

if your SD card seems a lot more full than it should be, you'll need to expand the filesystem:
- open a terminal on a computer connected to the same network as your shield
- execute: `ssh we@norns.local`
- password: `sleep`
- execute: `sudo raspi-config`
- navigate to `Advanced` and hit RETURN
- select `expand filesystem` and hit RETURN
- lots of activity will happen. when it's done, power down and reboot. if you get any errors, reboot again.
- if you SSH back into norns and execute `df -h`, you'll see the newly expanded capacity.

## notes

- the shield does not have a headphone output, but headphones work fine on the main output. the headphone gain level within the norns menu does nothing in this case.
- the battery indication will not function, as there's no battery.
